// Question no 30

// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
// • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
// • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

let admin:string[]=["Amber","Farah","Shala","Sarwat","Hina"]
console.log(`Hello ${admin[0]},would you like to see a status resort?`)
console.log(`Hello ${admin[1]},thank you for logging in again.`)
console.log(`Hello ${admin[2]},thank you for logging in again.`)
console.log(`Hello ${admin[3]},thank you for logging in again.`)
console.log(`Hello ${admin[4]},thank you for logging in again.`)
